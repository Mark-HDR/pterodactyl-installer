## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just Wings or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mark-HDR/pterodactyl-installer/main/installer.sh)
```
